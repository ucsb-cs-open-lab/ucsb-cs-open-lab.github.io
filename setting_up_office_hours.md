# {{page.title}}


This page assumes that:

* a calendar for your course has already been set up, and
* you have already been given access to `Make Changes to Events` on the appropriate Google Calendar for your course

# To add an office hour slot

1. Visit the page [Open Hours](/calendars/open) to find out when the rooms in Phelps are available.   You may schedule at any time that a room shows as reserved for open lab.  Note that just because the room shows as reserved doesn't mean it will be "open"; you may still need to get a key from the CS office staff.
2. If you decide to hold your office hours in one of the rooms reserved for open lab hours, please make a note of which room: e.g. 2510, 3525, or 3526.
3. Add an event to the appropriate calendar for your new office hours slot. You will likely want to set this up as a `Custom` repeating event, taking place every week, and ending on the last day of the quarter.  If there are university holidays, or exception, you can take care of those after creating the repeating event.
4. For the title of your event, please use the format: `CS130A, Chris, 3525`, that is:
   * `Course Number, Name, Room Number`

   Please do not include the phrase `Office Hours` or even `Ofc Hrs`; that's redundant,
   since these calendars are all office hours unless it says otherwise.  

   Please DO include the course number first, since that's needed for the master calendar to disambiguate which hours are for which course (see [Master Calendar](/calendars/all) to see what we mean.)

5. Once you've created the event, visit the [Calendars](/calendars) page, and check that your new office hour slots shows up correctly. 
6. Now that you've set up the repeating slot, if you want to delete individual events, or add "one off" non-repeating events, you may do so.

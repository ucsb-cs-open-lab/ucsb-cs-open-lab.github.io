# {{page.title}}

The CS department has allocated space in three departmentally controlled classrooms especially for "open lab" hours.

The idea arose when we needed space for undergrad LAs to hold office hours, and the TA trailer was already overcrowded.  Since then, we have discovered that it can be helpful to hold all or a portion of the office hours for a course&mdash;not just LA office hours, but also TA, and sometimes even instructor office hours in these spaces. 

Currently, this option is available for all of the course that are part of the LA program (i.e. 5A,5B,8,9,16,24,32,40,64,111,130A,130B,148,154,156,190A).

While you are not required to make use of this space, we want to encourage you to consider doing so.  Some of the benefits:

* Eases crowding in the TA trailer, making that space better for the other courses in the program
* More space for LA/TAs and students being helped to spread out
* Opportunities for students from different "generations" (i.e. first, second, third, fourth years) to interact with one another and form community.

This website is for you if:
* you are a TA/ULA in one of these courses
* you an instructor for one of the listed course, and would like your TAs/LAs to have this option, or perhaps you yourself would like to hold some office hours in this space.


Alternatives:
* Holding office hours in the TA trailer
* Holding office hours on Zoom
* Holding office hours in other spaces arranged by you.

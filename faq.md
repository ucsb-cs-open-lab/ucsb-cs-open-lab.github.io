Q: Can we double book the rooms in Phelps? I know my TAs said they had previously operated alongside others in 3525 when it wasn't disruptive (oftentimes only a handful of students are showing up for a given student hour)
: A: You can totally double, triple, quadruple book the space!  In fact, we kind of hope that there will be multiple TAs/LAs for multiple classes occupying the spaces; they are big enough to handle that, and we've found the cross-pollination to be more beneficial than distracting.

  If we get to where there are, let's say, twelve course holding office hours in the same space at the same time, we might "have a conversation about that"â€”that has happened sometimes in the past, and it's one of the two main reasons we are making these calendars and not just opening up the room and throwing caution to the wind.     
  
  
Q: Can we hold some office hours in Phelps and some elsewhere or online?
: A: Yes!  It's totally fine to use the Google Calendar to document office hours that are being held online only, or in other spaces such as the TA trailer, CSIL, a private lab, etc.
